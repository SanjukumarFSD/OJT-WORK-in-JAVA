//             Java Object & Classes :- 

//  Object :-   Objects have states and behaviors. Example: A dog has states-color, name, breed as well as behaviors -wagging, barking, eating. An object is an instance of a class.
//              If we consider the real-world we can find many objects around us, Cars, Dogs, Humans, etc. All these objects have a state and behavior.
//              If we consider a dog, then its state is - name, breed, color, and the behavior is - barking, wagging, running
//              A software object's state is stored in fields and behavior is shown via methods.


//  Class  :-   A class can be defined as a template/blue print that describes the behaviors/states that object of its type support.

// public class classobject {
//     int x = 5;
  
//     public static void main(String[] args) {
//       classobject myObj = new classobject();
//       System.out.println(myObj.x);
//     }
//   }
