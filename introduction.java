//              If we consider a dog, then its state is - name, breed, color, and the behavior is - barking, wagging, running
//              A software object's state is stored in fields and behavior is shown via methods.


//  Class  :-   A class can be defined as a template/blue print that describes the behaviors/states that object of its type support.
